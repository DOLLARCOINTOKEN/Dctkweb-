    <h1>DCTK: A Father’s Fight for a Lasting Legacy</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>My name is Cordell Dudley</strong>, and DCTK—Dollar Coin Token—is my heart in digital form. I’ve lived a life filled with battles: physical pain, emotional scars, and mental struggles. But through it all, one thing kept me going—my children.</p>

    <p>DCTK isn’t just a BRC-20 token on the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s my legacy, a testament to a father’s love, and a promise to my kids that even in the darkest times, you can build something that lasts.</p>

    <h2>The Struggles That Shaped Me</h2>
    <p>I grew up knowing hardship. As a child, I dealt with stomach pain and health issues that went untreated. My family struggled financially, but I learned early on that survival is about resilience.</p>

    <p>As I got older, the challenges didn’t stop—facing injustice, pain, and moments of hopelessness. But I kept fighting for one reason: my children. They were always the light that kept me moving forward.</p>

    <h2>The Birth of DCTK: A Father’s Vision</h2>
    <p>I created DCTK from a place of love and determination. I wanted to leave something lasting for my kids—something more than memories. Blockchain gave me that chance.</p>

    <p>The token’s design reflects this journey. It symbolizes strength, love, chaos, and persistence—everything I’ve lived through to create something that will outlive me.</p>

    <h2>What DCTK Means for My Kids</h2>
    <p>DCTK is more than a token—it’s a piece of me. It carries my love, my sacrifices, and the proof that I never gave up. I want my children to know their father left them something meaningful.</p>

    <h2>The Journey Forward: Building a Movement</h2>
    <p>This is just the beginning. I want DCTK to inspire others. Not for fame or profit, but to show that anyone can build a legacy through love and grit.</p>

    <h2>Be Part of the Legacy</h2>
